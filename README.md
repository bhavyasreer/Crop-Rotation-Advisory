# ðŸŒ± Crop Rotation Advisory - AI-Powered Agriculture Assistant

**Crop Rotation Advisory** is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers make data-driven decisions for crop planning. By analyzing soil nutrients, weather conditions, water availability, and other parameters, it recommends the **top 5 crops** best suited for a farm to maximize yield and profit.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

* **AI-Powered Crop Recommendation**: Suggests the most suitable crops based on multiple farm parameters.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Farmers can input farm details easily and get actionable recommendations.
* **Parameter Analysis**: Considers soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water source, previous crop, farm size, and more.
* **Multiple Crop Suggestions**: Provides the top 5 crops for optimal yield and profit.
* **Secure User Accounts**: Supports registration, login, and personalized dashboards.



## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (depending on your implementation)
* **AI/ML**: Python (Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch for prediction models)
* **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / Firebase (if used)
* **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Heroku / AWS (as applicable)
